# liquid

Your next stop should really be to read Liquid for Designers. Liquid is the glue that specifies all the rules needed to assemble your site, and is quite simple. Understand how Liquid works and you’ve mastered Jekyll. Jekyll provides some additional Liquid functions common for blogs.

Your next stop is to get some really nice customizable CSS scaffolding to control the layout for your site. While there’s a huge number of free CSS themes available, this isn’t 2002, so head on over to Twitter-Bootstrap (a project originally created by some of the programmers at Twitter, now evolved to it’s own community). The CSS-based grid layout and some very nice JQuery Javascripts tools can make your site as pretty and as interactive as you can imagine. Like Octopress, prebuilt CSS can lead to all sites looking the same. Check out themes for Bootstrap, and the excellent set of icons by FontAwesome.

Your final step is where the hacking really begins. Now and again you imagine something you just can’t do with these tools. Your only recourse is to ask on Stackoverflow for someone to do it for you learn a bit of Ruby. Anything you can write in Ruby you can add to Jekyll as a “plugin”, by defining a Liquid extension for a Ruby function. Ruby is clearly a favorite language of web-developers thanks to its dynamic-site implementation Ruby-on-Rails and a vibrant Github community, so there’s a wealth of useful tools, including an implementation to most APIs you might care to interact with (Github, Twitter, various Google APIs, are among the ones I’m using).
