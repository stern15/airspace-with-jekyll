                <p class="lead">If there is a lesson to be learned, it is the futility of seeking fulfillment in outer space. we need to judge ourselfs by who we are, not by where we go.</p>
                <p>Never in all their history have men been able truly to conceive of the world as one: a single sphere, a globe, having the qualities of a globe, a round earth in which all directions eventually meet,in which all men occupy as equals. The airman's earth, if free men make it, will be truly aound: a globe in practice, not in theory.</p>
                <p>Science cuts two ways, of course; its products can be used for both good and evil. But there's no turning back from science. The early warnings about technological dangers also come form science.</p>
                <p>What was most significant about the lunar voyage was not that man set foot on the Moon but that set eye on the earth.</p>
                <p>A chinese tale tells of some men sent to harm a young gitl who, upon seeing her beauty, become her protectors rather than her violators. That's how I felt seeing the Earth for the first time. I could not help but love and cherish her.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>For those who have seen the earth form space, and for the hundreds and perhaps thousands more &gt; who will, the experience most certainly changes your perspective. The things that we share in &gt; our world are far more valuable than those which divide us.</p>
                </blockquote>

                <h2 id="the-fina-frontier">The final Frontier</h2>
                <p>There can be no thought of finishing for 'aiming for the stars.' Both figuratively and literally, it is a task to occupy the generations. And no matters how much progress one makes, there is always the thrill of just beginning.</p>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>The dreams of the yesterday are the hopes of today and the reality of tommorrow. Science has not &gt; &gt; yet mastered prophecy. We predict too much for the next year and yet far too little for the &gt; &gt; next ten.</p>
                </blockquote>
                <blockquote>
                    <p>Spaceflight cannot be stopped. This is not the work of any one man or even a group pf men. It is a historical process which mankind is carrying out in accordance with the natural laws of human development.</p>
